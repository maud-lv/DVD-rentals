# Investigating a Relational Database

In the repo, you will find a PDF and a document with SQL queries.

For this project I explored a database about movie rentals, using SQL queries to answer interesting questions about the database. 

As part of my project, I ran SQL queries and built visualizations to showcase the output of my queries.

This is the graduation project to the Udacity course on SQL, within the nanodegree [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).
